			<h2 class="h12"> The Facts </h2>
			
			<ul class="p2">
				<li> The U.S. foreign-born population reached a record 44.4 million in 2017.</li>
				<li>although immigration has strong effects on relative supplies of different skill groups, local labour market outcomes for low skilled natives are not much affected by these relative supply shocks. </li>
				<li> Prosecutions at the border have exploded in the last decade. In 2002, there were 3,000 prosecutions for illegal entry and 8,000 for illegal re-entry; by 2012, the numbers were 48,000 and 37,000.</li>
				<li> Most immigrants (77%) are in the country legally. In 2017, 45% were naturalized U.S. citizens.</li>
				<li> Roughly half (45%) of the nation’s 44.4 million immigrants live in just three states: California (24%), Texas (11%) and New York (10%). California had the largest immigrant population of any state in 2017, at 10.6 million. Texas and New York had more than 4.5 million immigrants each.</li>
				<li> The nation’s unauthorized immigrant population grew rapidly between 1990 and 2007, reaching a peak of 12.2 million. Since then, the population declined to 10.5 million in 2017. Unauthorized immigrants from Mexico make up less than half of all unauthorized immigrants and have been a driver of the group’s population decline – the number of unauthorized immigrants from Mexico fell from a peak of 6.9 million in 2007 to 4.9 million in 2017. </li>
				<li> Education levels among the nation’s immigrants have been steadily rising since the 1960s, just like the native-born population. While there have been gains across the board, the increases have been most dramatic among immigrants from Asia, Europe and the Middle East and less so among those from Mexico and Central America.</li>
				<li> While immigrants account for 13.6% of the U.S. population, the U.S.-born children of immigrants (second-generation Americans) make up another 12.0% of the nation’s population. By 2050, these two groups could account for 19% and 18% of the population, respectively, according to Pew Research Center projections.</li>
				<li> The age structure of the U.S. immigrant population has changed alongside the changing immigrant origin regions. As the largest group of immigrants shifted from Europeans and Canadians to Mexicans, the largest age group moved from ages 65-69 in 1960 to ages 40-44 in 2017. Today, European and Canadian immigrants tend to be older, with a median age of 52 in 2017. Mexican immigrants are among the youngest, with a median age of 42. The age distribution of the U.S.-born population has also transformed. In 1960, the late years of the Baby Boom generation, the population was younger than in 2017, when these age groups were much more evenly dispersed.</li>
				<li> The foreign-born population residing in the U.S. reached a record 44.4 million, or 13.6% of the U.S. population, in 2017. This immigrant population has more than quadrupled since the 1960s, when the 1965 Immigration and Naturalization Act took effect. Though growth has begun to slow in recent years, the number of immigrants living in the United States is projected to almost double by 2065.</li>
