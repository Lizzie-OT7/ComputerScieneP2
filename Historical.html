			<h2 class="h12"> The History </h2>
				<h3> What major events across the span of history affect the mainstream view of immigrants in America? Or enable more people to want to immigrate to of away from a country?</h3>
				
					<ul class="p">
						<li> 1942: Labor shortages during World War II prompted the United States and Mexico to form the Bracero Program, which allows Mexican agricultural workers to enter the United States temporarily. The program lasts until 1964. </li>
						<li> 1965: The Immigration and Nationality Act overhauls the American immigration system. The Act ends the national origin quotas enacted in the 1920s which favored some racial and ethnic groups over others. </li>
						<li> April-October 1980: During the Mariel boatlift, roughly 125,000 Cuban refugees make a dangerous sea crossing in overcrowded boats to arrive on the Florida shore seeking political asylum. </li>
						<li> 1986: President Ronald Reagan signs into law the Simpson-Mazzoli Act, which grants amnesty to more than 3 million immigrants living illegally in the United States. </li>
						<li> 2001: U.S. Senators Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) and Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) propose the first Development, Relief and Education of Alien Minors (DREAM) Act, which would provide a pathway to legal status for Dreamers, undocumented immigrants brought to the United States illegally by their parents as children. The bill-and subsequent iterations of it-don't pass. </li>
						<li> 2012: President Barack Obama signs Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) which temporarily shields some Dreamers from deportation, but doesnâ€™t provide a path to citizenship. </li>
					</ul>

			<h2 class="h12"> More recently </h2>
					<ul>
						<li> 2017: President Donald Trump issues two executive orders-both titled "Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States"-aimed at curtailing travel and immigration from six majority Muslim countries (Chad, Iran, Libya, Syria, Yemen, Somalia) as well as North Korea and Venezuela. Both of these travel bans are challenged in state and federal courts. </li>
						<li> 2018: In April 2018, the travel restrictions on Chad are lifted. In June 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court uphold a third version of the ban on the remaining seven countries. </li>
						<li> 2019: The Supreme Court discuss the DACA program as thousands protest outside the Capital Building.  </li>
