			<h2 class="h12"> The Environmental Effects </h2>
				<h3> What effect does the environment have on immigration? </h3>
					
					<ol class="p2">
						<li>Extreme environmental events such as hurricanes, tsunamis, floods and landslides can also cause immediate loss of income and therefore encourage population displacement.</li>
						<li>Climate change has important implications for migration; for example, drought can degrade livelihoods and weaken people's ability to cope with poverty and conflict.</li>
						<li>Resource mobilization theory (RM) views formal organizations rather than individuals as central to the analysis of social movements.</li>
						<li>Due to climate change, some agricultural families arenâ€™t able to grow their crops. Due to this they are often left helpless to find new jobs or even completely migrate, all together.</li>
					</ol>
		
				<p class="p"> The fact of the matter is that there is that we ourselves affect what happens with immigration. The way we treat our planet, while we may not see the effects of it directly, still impact the world around us. Many immigrants move because they are trying to get away from a unsustainable life, unfortunatly drought aren't a rare thing across all of America. This causes families across our southern border to have failed crops and dying heard. Can we really blame these families for wanting to simply survive? </p>
