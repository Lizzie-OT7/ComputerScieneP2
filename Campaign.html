				<p class="p2"> We are a non-profit organization aiming towards providing more transparent facts about the current immigration policies and live of these oppressed people. We reach towards spreading awarness and sharing testimoinial as well as only the pure facts. We as Americans, a country built on immigration, need to come together in order to create more plausible reforms to mutually benefit all around.  </p>
			
					<p class="p"> "A crush of migrant families crossing the U.S.-Mexico border has strained the system managed by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Border officials have said for months they were overwhelmed and needed more money. Since the deaths of children in custody, more medical staff and medical checks have been added.... One mother said she arrived with her 3-year-old daughter who was soaking wet. There were no dry clothes, so the child slept in the cold facility with wet clothing and woke with fever and congestion. They were transferred but the girl was still sick weeks later.No one was allowed to shower for at least five days, some women reported, even after their children were vomiting." - An article from APNEWS.
					<p class="p2"> Are we really going to let more families like this suffer at the hands of a bad system that won't offer humans the same basic humans rights as everyone else? This is why this campaign exist, this is why we need more awarness being pulled to an issue that is still happening, one that is still taking place along our borders. We need to command real change towards proper and benificial immigration reform, we need to elect officials that value both morals, and a sound logical mind. We can all make a change if you just decide to take the first step towards making one.
